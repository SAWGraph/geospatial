For SAWGraph, admininstrative regions include
* States (from KnowWhereGraph)
* Counties (from KnowWhereGraph)
* Towns (from US Census Bureau county subdivisions)

States and counties are represented in [GADM](https://gadm.org/data.html).

County subdivisions are easy to link to Data Commons by their 10-digit FIPS code (GEOID).
Their shapefiles are available [here](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php).
